World's Smallest Violin\n
AJR\n
\n
...\n
The world's smallest violin\n
Really needs an audience\n
So if I do not find somebody soon\n
(That's right, that's right)\n
I'll blow up in to smithereens\n
And spew my tiny symphony\n
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you\n
\n
Somewhere in the universe\n
Somewhere, someone's got it worse\n
Wish that made it easier\n
Wish I didn't feel the hurt\n
The world's smallest violin\n
Really needs an audience\n
So if I do not find somebody soon\n
\n
I'll blow up into smithereens\n
And spew my tiny symphony\n
All up and down the city street\n
While trying to put my mind at ease\n
Like finishing this melody\n
This feels like a necessity\n
So this could be the death of me\n
Or maybe just a better me\n
Now come in with the Tympany's\n
And take a shot of Hennessy\n
I know I'm not there mentally\n
But you could be the remedy\n
So let me play my violin for you\n"
